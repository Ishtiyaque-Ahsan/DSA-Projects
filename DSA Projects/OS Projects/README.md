Operating Systems Concepts Implementation 

• Implemented CPU Scheduling Algorithms in OS with C++ : 
       Taking process_id , Arrival Time and Burst Time and Priority of the processes as input, 
       these scheduling algorithms give the schedule of the execution of those processes. 
       
           • Round Robin, Priority and Shortest Job First (Preemptive and Non-Preemptive)
            
           • Multi-Level Queue and Multi-Level Feedback Queue.

                
• Implemented Solution of Deadlock Problem using Semaphore & Banker’s algorithm in C++ 
 
• Implemented Page Replacement Algorithms in Memory Management :
          
            FIFO, Least Recently Used, Optimal Algorithm
